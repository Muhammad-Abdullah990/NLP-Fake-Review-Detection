# NLP-Fake-Review-Detection
1. Project OverviewThe objective of this project is to develop a robust system capable of classifying product reviews as "Genuine" or "Fake." Unlike standard classifiers that analyze text in isolation, this system utilizes a Retrieval-Augmented approach. By retrieving semantically similar reviews from a curated dataset, the model gains additional context to make a more informed classification decision.2. System ArchitectureThe pipeline is divided into two primary phases: the Indexing Phase (Offline) and the Inference Phase (Online).2.1 Indexing Phase (Data Preparation)In this stage, the system processes a dataset of reviews to create a searchable knowledge base.Data Loading: The fake_reviews_dataset.csv is parsed using Pandas.Embedding Generation: Each review is converted into a high-dimensional vector using the sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model.Vector Storage: These embeddings are stored in a FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) index, allowing for lightning-fast similarity searches using L2 distance.2.2 Inference Phase (Detection Pipeline)When a user submits a review for analysis, the following steps occur:Vectorization: The input review is converted into an embedding using the same MiniLM model.Contextual Retrieval: The FAISS index is queried to find the $k=5$ most similar reviews from the database.Augmentation: The input review is concatenated with the retrieved reviews to form a "Contextual Prompt."Classification: A DistilBERT model (distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) analyzes the augmented text to determine the final label.3. Technical Implementation3.1 Components & ModulesVector Engine (build_index.py): Utilizes PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers to generate embeddings. It saves the state into reviews.index (vector data) and reviews.pkl (metadata).Classifier Engine (app.py): Implements the logic where NEGATIVE sentiment labels from DistilBERT are mapped to "Fake" and POSITIVE to "Genuine."User Interface: A Streamlit-based web dashboard that provides real-time analysis and displays the retrieved context for transparency.
